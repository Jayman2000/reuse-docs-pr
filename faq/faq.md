# General

## I am short on time. Can you give me the quickest possible summary?

We want to improve the way that people license their software projects. We
propose three steps to achieve this:

### 1. Choose and provide a license

Find the SPDX identifier of your license in the [SPDX License
List](https://spdx.org/licenses/). Download the license text for your license
from the
[license-list-data](https://github.com/spdx/license-list-data/tree/master/text)
repository and put it in `LICENSES/<identifier>.txt`, where `<identifier>` is
equal to the SPDX identifier.

### 2. Add a license header to each file

Then, for all files, edit the header to contain the following:

```
# SPDX-Copyright: <year> <copyright holder> <email address>
#
# SPDX-License-Identifier: <identifier>
```

### 3. Confirm compliance with the linter

Use the [REUSE tool](https://github.com/fsfe/reuse-tool) to automate some of
these steps, and to check whether you did everything correctly.

## What is copyright?

Copyright is a legal construct that grants someone exclusive rights over a
creative work. The most important exclusive right is in the name: The right
to produce copies. Only the copyright holder is allowed to give new copies of
their work to people.

Usually the author is the copyright holder, but often copyright is
transferred to the author's employer. In most places, you do not need to do
anything to gain copyright. As soon as you make a creative work, you (or your
employer) instantly gain copyright over it.

Creative Commons provides a better and lengthier answer in their [Frequently
Asked
Questions](https://creativecommons.org/faq/#what-is-copyright-and-why-does-it-matter).

## What is a license?

One problem with copyright as it pertains to software is that it makes
software unshareable by default. A license changes that. A license defines
the terms under which the copyright holder allows the recipient of the
license to use the software.  If the license allows the recipient to
[use, study, share and
improve](https://fsfe.org/freesoftware/basics/4freedoms.html) the software,
then that software is Free Software.

## Which license should I choose?

## Do I really need to include the license and copyright headers in all files? Why should I care?

## What is SPDX?

SPDX stands for [Software Package Data Exchange](https://spdx.org/). It is a
project by the [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) and the
rock upon which REUSE is built. SPDX defines a standardized way to share
copyright and licensing information between projects and people. Most
importantly for REUSE, SPDX maintains the [SPDX License
List](https://spdx.org/licenses/), which defines standardized identifiers for a
lot of licenses.

# The tool

## How do I install and use the REUSE tool?

The REUSE tool is a handy companion that can verify your compliance with
REUSE and automate a lot of adjacent tasks. You can find the full
documentation for the tool at <https://reuse.readthedocs.io/>. But the short
of it is:

```
$ pip3 install --user fsfe-reuse 
$ export PATH=~/.local/bin:$PATH
$ reuse --help
```

## How do I exclude a file from REUSE compliance testing?

If the file is a build artifact and you use Git, simply make sure that the file
is covered by your `.gitignore` file.

Otherwise, you cannot exclude files from REUSE compliance testing. It would go
entirely against the purpose of REUSE: making sure that every file has a
copyright and license tag.

If you really want to exclude a file, consider using the
[CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) license for this
file.  By doing this, you put the file in the public domain, or your country's
equivalent.

There is one exception: License files are automatically excluded from compliance
testing.

<!-- FIXME: Link to uncopyrightable question and DEP5 question -->

## Do you support a version control system other than Git?

Currently we do not, but please [get in
touch](https://github.com/fsfe/reuse-tool/issues).

# Licensing and compliance

## Is there a standard format for declaring copyright?

Copyright year copyright holder email

## Which years do I include in the copyright statement?

## Do I need to include both GPL-3.0-or-later and GPL-3.0-only in my repository?

Members of the GPL family are listed separately in the SPDX License List as
-only and -or-later, even though the license texts are identical. If you have
code under only one of these licenses, we recommend that you only include that
one license.

If you have code under both licenses, we recommend that you include both
licenses separately.

If you do not want to include both licenses separately (e.g., for space
reasons), we you can create the file `LICENSES/GPL-3.0.txt` and add the
following header:

```
Valid-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-only
Valid-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later
```

## What are license exceptions and what do I do with them?

## Do I use SPDX-Copyright, Copyright, or Â©?

## Which files are copyrightable?

README

LICENSE (strange exception)

## What to do with uncopyrightable files?

## Where else do I put my license information?

README

## What is a copyright holder, and what is an author?

## How do I deal with a file that has been edited by many people?

## Can I use DEP5 to declare licensing and copyright?

See next question.

## Can I bulk-license whole directories?

DEP5

## Can I license only a part of a file as being under a different license?

## Should I move my existing LICENSE or COPYING file?

## Should I put comment headers in my license files?

## I only have a single license file. Should I still create a LICENSES directory?

Maybe

## Should I edit my license files?

NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

## Can I remove the license and copyright information from minified code (e.g., JavaScript)?

Probably shouldn't

(but REUSE only applies to source repositories)

# For lawyers and legal experts

## I am a lawyer and want a bill of materials

Install the reuse tool and run `reuse spdx -o reuse.spdx` in the project root
to create an [SPDX
document](https://spdx.org/spdx-specification-21-web-version).
